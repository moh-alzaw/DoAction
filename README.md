# DoAction
In C++, control flow such as executing code once or a certain amount of times can be tedious. Now you can easily do so.
For Unreal Engine C++ programmers, this can be especially useful as there is no built in "Do Once" or "Do N" C++ equivalent.

## Setting Up
### Step 1:
Download the files in the respository and add them to your C++ or Unreal Engine project.
#### C++:
Simply add it to your project directory.
#### Unreal Engine:
Add them to the source folder of your Unreal Engine project directory.
Example directory: MyGame\Source\MyGame
### Step 2:
Use ```#include "DoAction.h"``` for any C++ (.cpp) or Header (.h) files that will use DoAction.
